## My computer experience so far
I completed a 3-year Diploma in Information Technology and my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering. During my studies, I worked on projects such as Android City Traveller and Secure Banking using Blockchain, which helped me learn how to build applications end-to-end and strengthen my problem-solving skills. I also worked for around two years as an Android Developer in India, where I developed features, fixed bugs, integrated APIs, and worked with databases as part of a real development workflow.

## Where I’ll use what I learn in this course
I want to use what I learn in this course to improve how I design and build web applications, especially writing clean, well-structured code and creating responsive user interfaces. I plan to apply these skills to build portfolio-ready projects and connect them with backend development in the future. Since this is my last semester, I want to use this course to strengthen my fundamentals and feel confident building complete, organized projects.
